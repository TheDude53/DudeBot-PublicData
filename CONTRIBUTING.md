# Contributing

Before submitting any data, please make sure it is not offensive and is safe for work (SFW). Roasts are granted some exceptions to this rule.

Please also make sure it follows the same JSON format (escaping quotation marks, using plain apostrophes instead of curly ones, etc.)
Any pull requests made not following this format may not be merged.

### Notes

You can use `%user%` in roasts as a placeholder for the user's name.

When contributing to the AI, please keep all inputs lowercase and only use punctuation when it isn't a period.

If you're creating a custom status, please do not reference any user in a creepy way (e.g.: "Watching **you**").  
You can use the states `online`, `idle`, and `dnd` to customize the status. It's a little complicated, but you'll probably figure it out. You can refer to [Discord's documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway-events#activity-object-activity-types) for more information.
