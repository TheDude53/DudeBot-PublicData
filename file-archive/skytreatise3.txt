Pidgey: your like an insect buzzing around annoying everyone else. you lie to get what you want but not for the right reasons. how can you possibly live with yourself when you destroy lives and guilt trip? your just as bad as Jxo and you show no remorse. And that pisses me off. Sky, I'm not shit talking you, I'm simply telling you the truth. Sky, how do you feel about lying about committing suicide? (note: around 50 times) do you feel guilty about lying about cutting yourself, or trying to make others have pity for you? do you feel anything? do you? no you don't.
Sky, fragile? Really? You're so fragile that you have the narcissism to lie about killing yourself (note: around 50 times) so fragile eh? you're a pathetic person Sky what you choose to do is hurtful to everyone, but your so caught up in getting what you want, when you want it like a toddler, that you fail to see all the pain you cause to others. If your truly fragile sky, if you truly truly are, then you'd feel at least a little bad for hurting others. you're not fragile sky. your a coward who gets scared when you're confronted with the truth. you "stutter" and "sweet talk" and its pitiful
the fact that you have the audacity to even try it pisses me off
Sky, If you apologize for everything you've done, to everyone, I will forgive you. This is your way out sky, ok?
if you promise to be truthful and kind, if you apologize to everyone you've hurt, I will forgive you and it'll be like a clean slate for you
Sky, I don't know how you think you're the victim but you're not. We don't wanna trash talk you, we just want an apology. We want you to recognize what you did as bad, and say you won't do it again. And then we want you to follow through with it. Do you understand?
(Sky proceeded to change the subject, using freudian excuses.)
Sky, you messed up plenty of times, but your biggest mistake was ignoring my plea to help you. May you remember this day sky. For this is the day, where you could have been forgiven. The best way to destroy an enemy is to make them you're friend. I really wish you could have heard me when I had the energy to forgive you. But you're unable to fess up to your mistakes. And for that I truly pity you.
Me: We did not manipulate others for sympathy. We did not guilt-trip others for sympathy. We did not RUN from attempts to have our names cleared. We did not falsely apologize and then continue what warranted the apology. You did.
Pidgey: Higano, there's no point anymore
he's deliberately ignoring us
Because running from his problems sounds easier to him than facing them.
SKY YOUR NOTHING BUT A HELPLESS PIECE OF SHIT WHO WANTS ATTENTION
I WAS TRYING MY BEST TO BE NICE
drugs: sky. I'm a narcissist but I can still own my shit. No offence mate
HELL THERES A GOOD CHANCE YER LYING ABOUT WHATEVER DISORDERS YOU SAY YOU HAVE
Pidgey: YOU LIE TO GET WHAT YOU WANT BUT RUN WHEN SOMEONE TRIES TO TELL THE TRUTH TO YOU. SKY, THE DAY THAT YOU LEARN YOU CANT RUN FOREVER, WILL BE THE DAY I LAUGH. I CANT WAIT FOR YOU TO DIE SKY
I CANT FUCKING WAIT
AND I WISH, I TRULY TRULY WISH YOU COULD DIE BENEATH MY FOOT AS YOU REALIZE HOW BADLY YOU MESSED UP AND PLEAD FOR THAT TIME I WAS WILLING TO FORGIVE YOU. SKY YOU VAIN ASS YOU'D RATHER HAVE ENEMIES THAN FRIENDS? THEN ENJOY THE ENEMIES SKY.
SOME DAY SOMEONE YOU REALLY LOVE, SOMEONE WHO REALLY LOVED YOU, WILL WALK AWAY AND YOU'LL WONDER WHY AND YOUR PEA SIZED BRAIN WILL BE UNABLE TO COMPREHEND THAT THE REASON THEY LEFT IS BECAUSE OF YOU BECAUSE YOUR LYING AND MANIPULATION OVERRIDES THEIR LOVE FOR YOU
and sky when that happens, remember this and remember it well. The truth costs nothing sky, but lies? lies cost everything.  remember that when your begging the person who loved you the most, to come back. Remember that.
Sky‚òÜ: because all u do is sfucking harrass me. you want me to change but ur not helping

Harass you? How so? You are actively running from an attempt to reject that past anger.
[All in all, Sky rejected a genuine attempt to forgive him. I rest my case.]
