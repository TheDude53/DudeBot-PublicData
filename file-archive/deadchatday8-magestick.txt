Alright then, this is was a week that win93 trollbox is down, sadly. Day 8 is going very quietly. It will be up some time but later until the weekend.Keep chatting, everyone and stay safe. I hope everything is all right with the Sage.

ANTON'S EDIT: Welp, Primari. I feel as quiet as you. It's kinda peaceful and stuff. I'm not losing hope yet, not even PreDarkAge.
