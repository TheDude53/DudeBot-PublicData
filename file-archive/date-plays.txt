A boy who joined this for the first time in 2020 named "dtp" date-plays changed him name a lot of times. Even tho date-plays is 10 and a half and trollbox is 10+ i think is still ok. He inspired brindu to also join trollbox in 2020 nov (i think) and she taked a lil break in the start of 2021 and joined back again in 2021 april. But still i think i will save that for later on while you're reading this. The history of date-plays's name is so long that i will start now and type here only what i remember. So: actually i am not gonna make this because i have a 7â€Œ/10 memory so yes. I started a rp in 16 apr and end it in 22 apr. The rp is still with me and i think i regret i said that "this is my last rp ever". I actually ended my 6th rp which is now full and i dont have any spaces left for another ppl. Bye.
