 undefined: characters who fit into multiple tiers (specified individually)
 unknown: characters who do not fit in the current tier system
 Ø: Data on this tier does not exist yet]
-1: Tier for overpowered OCs, far weaker than most trollbox characters; the lowest tier, civilians and fodder also go here.

 1: Overpowered meme characters
 2: Lesser gods
 3: Average gods
 4: Higher gods
 5: Greater gods whose power trivializes that of tier 3 and is above tier 4; tier 3 and below are deathly afraid of this tier and above.
93: The gods in control of windows 93 as we know it, such as bots, bot creators, and gods powerful enough to completely surpass other tier 5s
 ∝: Gods far above tier 93
 ∞: Gods far above tier ∝, or the maximum power that the strongest tier 93's could ever have (thought still below Ω)
 Ω: The creators of Win93 (janken, zombectro, etc.)
