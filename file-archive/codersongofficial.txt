i dunno what i was thinking,leaving the trollbox bheind now i suffer the curse and now i am blind. with all this anger,hate and sadness coming to haunt me forever i can't wait for the virus at the end of the link is this the trollbox i am seeking, or seeking someone to ban him, stuck in my own computer i wanna set myself free. maybe i should chase and block so they can stop it it won't be long before i become hacked, it's been so long since i have last seen the trollbox lost to this monster the man behynd the spam bots since you've been blocked  i've singing this stupid song so i could ponder the sanity of your trollbox friend i wish i blocked him in the present with the gift of peace but the coder keeps luring like a ferocius snake, your sweet little chat, your bots, is all i remember  those fuzzy memories mess with my temper spam bots are killing me, but blocking is not justified what happened to the trollbox, i'm terrified it lingers to my mind and the tought keeps getting bigger, i'm sorry my trollbox friends, i wish i was still there it's been so long, since i have last seen the trollbox lost to this coder to the man behynd the spam bots since you've been blocked  i've been singing this stupid song so i could ponder the sanity of your dear troll friend. (this song was made by BLOOOOOOOP using the song made by the living tombstone, if u want to do a yt vid about it, plz credit me and the living tombstone)
