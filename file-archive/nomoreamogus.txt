STOP POSTING ABOUT AMONG US‌‌! I'M TIRED OF SEEING IT‌‌! My friends on TikTok send me memes, on Dis‍cord its fucking memes. I was in a server, right, and ALL the channels are just Among Us stuff. I showed my Champion underwear to my girlfriend, and the logo I flipped it and I said "Hey babe, when the underwear sus‌‌! HAHA‌‌! Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding DiDiDing‌‌!" I fucking looked at a trash can and I said "Thats a bit sussy‌‌!" I looked at my penis, I thought of the astronauts helmet and I go "PENIS? MORE LIKE PEN-SUS‌‌!" AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
