It's July 3rd, and Trollbox has been down for 6 days. That is the deadchat. I've been bored these days, maybe everyone else. It's because of the deadchat, probably. First MySpace, then Trollbox. It's such a downer. I am forced to Trollbox.party myself. Keep in ming that I'm not dead until Day 15, which is July 12th. I'm sorry, but I have to do it. Just PLEASE revive Trollbox before the day. It's a dark age. I'm bored, haven't had a good Trollbox time in a while. But that is probably gonna change. Please spread the word. This is Anton, and I'll see you tomorrow. [Anton]
