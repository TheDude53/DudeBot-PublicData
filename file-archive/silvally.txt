There is the some things you need to know

Silvally is available in the games unlike Arceus, which requires an event.
Someone has given all Memory Discs to player, while Plates needs to search.
Both they have a signature move that can have a different type (Silvally signature is more powerful btw)

Result: Silvally is more suitable for beginners
